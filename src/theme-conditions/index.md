# Theme Conditions

**Elementor Pro 2.0** introduced a condition-based template display mechanism. This allows users to specify under what conditions a template will be displayed. The conditions built into the mechanism cover most of the native *WordPress Template Hierarchy*, but sometimes you need more control with more specific conditions.

Elementor Pro provides a set of tools for external developers to create and register custom theme conditions.

## Condition Usage

Conditions determine where templates are displayed on a site, where popups are embedded and where code snippets are included. These conditions are used in the Elementor **Theme Builder**, Elementor **Popups** and Elementor **Custom Code**. 

When defining the display conditions, multiple conditions can be selected by clicking the "*Add Condition*" button. These conditions can be either included or excluded, thus creating complex display rules.
