**Elementor Pro 2.0** introduced condition based template display mechanism, which allows users to specify where to display the template. The builtin conditions covers most of the native *WordPress Template Hierarchy*, but sometimes you need more control with more specific conditions.

Elementor Pro provides a set of tools for external developers to create and register custom theme conditions.

## Condition Usage

Conditions are used in Elementor **Theme Builder**, Elementor **Popups** and Elementor **Custom Code**. Conditions determine where templates are displayed in the site, where popups are embed and where code snippets are included.

When defining the display conditions, multiple conditions can be selected by clicking the "*Add Condition*" button. In addition, conditions can be either included or excluded, thus creating complex display rules.
