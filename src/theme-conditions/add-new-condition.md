# Add New Condition

<Badge type="tip" vertical="top" text="Elementor Pro" /> <Badge type="warning" vertical="top" text="Advanced" />

Elementor's template display mechanism has several built-in conditions, but external developers can create and register their own conditions.

## Registering Conditions

To register new conditions, you just need to initiate the condition class:

```php
function register_new_theme_conditions( $conditions_manager  ) {

	require_once( __DIR__ . '/theme-conditions/condition-1.php' );
	require_once( __DIR__ . '/theme-conditions/condition-2.php' );

	$conditions_manager->get_condition( 'general' )->register_sub_condition( new \Condition_1() );
	$conditions_manager->get_condition( 'general' )->register_sub_condition( new \Condition_2() );

}
add_action( 'elementor/theme/register_conditions', 'register_new_theme_conditions' );
```

This code snippet hooks to the `elementor/theme/register_conditions` action hook which holds the conditions manager. The manager then registers the condition by initiating new condition instances.

## Registering Sub-Conditions

There are two ways to register sub-conditions, either from the conditions manager or from the condition class itself.

To register sub-conditions from the manager, use the following code:

```php
function register_new_theme_conditions( $conditions_manager  ) {

	require_once( __DIR__ . '/theme-conditions/main-condition.php' );
	require_once( __DIR__ . '/theme-conditions/sub-condition-1.php' );
	require_once( __DIR__ . '/theme-conditions/sub-condition-2.php' );

	$conditions_manager
		->get_condition( 'general' )
		->register_sub_condition( new \Main_Condition() );

	$conditions_manager
		->get_condition( 'main_condition_name' )
		->register_sub_condition( new \Sub_Condition_1() );

	$conditions_manager
		->get_condition( 'main_condition_name' )
		->register_sub_condition( new \Sub_Condition_2() );

}
add_action( 'elementor/theme/register_conditions', 'register_new_theme_conditions' );
```

To register sub-conditions from the main condition class, see the [sub-conditions](./sub-conditions/) section.
