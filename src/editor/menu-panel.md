The **Menu Panel** is the main panel in [The Editor](/editor/) from where the user can navigate to other panel. In other words it's like the dashboard for other Elementor panels.

## Structure and Functionality

The panel has two sections:

* **Settings** - Links to other panels controlling the settings.
* **Navigate From Page** - External links and tools.

## Extending the Menu Panel

Developers can add new links to the menu panel. For consistency, the links should open other Elementor panels.
