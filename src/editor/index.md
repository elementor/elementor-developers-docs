The editor is the environment in which users create pages and control site settings. Editor is a general term that includes two main areas - the preview and the panel. Each of these areas contains inner areas which can be extended by 3rd party developers.

## Structure

The editor refers to the entire editing screen and consists of two main areas:

* [Elementor Preview](/editor/elementor-preview)
* [Elementor Panel](/editor/elementor-panel)

## Editor Panels

The panel can be compared to a sideboard and its functionality will depend on what panel is being displayed:

* [Menu Panel](/editor/menu-panel)
* [Site Settings Panel](/editor/site-settings-panel)
* [User Preferences Panel](/editor/user-preferences-panel)
* [Page Settings Panel](/editor/page-settings-panel)
* [History Panel](/editor/history-panel)
* [Widget Panel](/editor/widgets-panel)
