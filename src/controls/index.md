Elementor Controls are **input fields** and **UI elements** that are used to construct an interface. Controls allow the user to customize the available settings from the panel and change the design in the preview.

Elementor includes a wide range of controls out-of-the-box. They are used in widgets and panels to collect user data and generate custom output based on user selections.
